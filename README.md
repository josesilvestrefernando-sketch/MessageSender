# MessageSender


## 📖 Description

This project is a simple web-based messaging application built using **Apache Tomcat** and Java Servlets. It simulates sending messages similar to email, but it only works within a **Local Area Network (LAN)**.

The system does not use real email protocols or external mail servers. Instead, it demonstrates how users can send and receive messages locally, making it suitable for LAN-based multiplayer applications.

This project was created for learning purposes, focusing on basic web development concepts using servlets.
